        <h3>List of Steps and Progress Tracker</h3>
        <p>
            This list of steps and editable progress tracker is a resource I (Spencer, Head of Customer Services) created for my relocation to Italy. While it offers valuable guidance, it’s absolutely essential that you conduct your own research to understand the specific processes for the municipality you’ll be living in. Steps and requirements can vary across regions, and immigration is a serious matter that demands thorough preparation.

      <h3  class="text-no-inherit">3. Secure Accommodation Prior to Coming</h3>
      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          <strong>Renting:</strong> Find a rental property, sign a lease agreement, and ensure the contract is registered with the Agenzia delle Entrate and legalized as per your municipality's standard for proof of residency.<br>
          <strong>Staying with Friends or Family:</strong> Obtain a notarized Declaration of Hospitality (Dichiarazione di Ospitalità) and copies of your host's lease or property deed and utility bills.
      </p>
      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
        <strong> In Both Cases:</strong> look at your comune’s requirements and ensure you collect the required documents such as utility bills or other proof of residence in your, or your landlord’s name.
      </p>
      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          Notes: If looking to rent — many short-term landlords will not want to go through the process of registering a contract. An easy workaround to this is finding a suitable Airbnb or short-term rental and offering to pay extra for a contract. I would start by offering an additional month's rent if they provide and register a contract. A month’s rent in Italy is typically significantly lower than in the U.S..

      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          Enter Italy on a suitable visa (American citizens can usually stay up to 90 days).
      </p>
      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          Choose a comune (municipality) where you’ll apply for residency and submit your JS application. Ensure the comune you’re staying in has familiarity with processing JS applications.

          Notes: When planning this step, consider flying directly into Italy from a non-Schengen country (i.e., a country outside the EU). By doing so, you’ll receive a passport stamp upon entry, allowing you to skip step 5 (in most municipalities) — saving you from what could otherwise be an exhausting and time-consuming experience.

      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          <strong>Entering from a Non-Schengen Country:</strong> Ensure your passport is stamped upon arrival. This stamp acts as your declaration. However, in some municipalities, it is expected that you complete this step regardless of your stamped passport (this was the case for me).

      <p  class="text-no-inherit">
          <strong>Stay at a hotel or Airbnb:</strong> Italian law requires your host to report your arrival to local authorities within 24 hours. To avoid issues, confirm with your host in advance that they will comply with this requirement. Again, double check what is accepted in your municipality.

          <strong>Entering from a Schengen Country:</strong> Visit the local Questura within 8 days to officially declare your presence.<br>
          Ensure you bring your flight ticket, passport, flight booking, and all evidence that you just flew into the country.

          Notes: Questura sucks. I, a grown man that maybe cries 2-3 times a year, was almost brought to tears by an immigration officer screaming at me at the top of their lungs for reasons I still cannot decipher.

    <h2 class="header" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I gather the necessary documents to relocate to Italy for Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
    <p>Gather your vital records—birth, marriage, and death certificates for yourself and your ancestors—plus naturalization records or “no record found” statements. Authenticate all non‑Italian documents with apostilles and certified translations before you arrive.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is an Italian Codice Fiscale and how can I obtain it?</h3>
    <p>The Codice Fiscale is your Italian tax code, required for everything from opening a bank account to signing a lease. You can apply online through the Agenzia delle Entrate or visit a local office in Italy with your passport and visa to receive it.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What proof of accommodation do I need to establish residency?</h3>
    <p>If renting, you must sign and register your lease with the Agenzia delle Entrate and provide utility bills. If staying with friends or family, obtain a notarized Dichiarazione di Ospitalità along with your host’s registered lease or property deed and utility bills.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is a Dichiarazione di Presenza and when must I declare my presence?</h3>
    <p>If you enter Italy from a non‑Schengen country, ask for a passport stamp on arrival—it acts as your Dichiarazione di Presenza. From within Schengen, you must visit the local Questura within eight days with your passport, flight ticket, and supporting documents to officially declare your presence.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I apply for residency (residenza) in Italy?</h3>
    <p>Go to your comune’s Ufficio Anagrafe with your passport, visa, proof of accommodation, Dichiarazione di Presenza, and the completed dichiarazione di residenza form. Once submitted, you’ll receive a receipt and the process to issue your certificato di residenza will begin.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I obtain a Permesso di Soggiorno for a Jure Sanguinis application?</h3>
    <p>Pick up the giallo kit at Poste Italiane, complete the forms, and gather required documents (passport, visa, photos, insurance, proof of funds, Marca da Bollo). Submit at the post office, keep your receipt, and attend the Questura appointment for fingerprinting and permit issuance.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I schedule my Jure Sanguinis appointment at the comune?</h3>
    <p>After you have your certificato di residenza, contact the Ufficio di Stato Civile—usually online or by email—to request a Jure Sanguinis appointment. Bring your residency certificate and ask which documents your specific comune requires.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How long does the Jure Sanguinis application process take when applying from Italy?</h3>
    <p>Processing times vary by comune and workload, ranging from a few weeks to up to 36 months. While some municipalities process quickly, others may take longer—so it’s best to ask your comune for an estimate.</p>
