            <strong>Consular Application</strong> – This applies to straightforward cases where citizenship is passed down through an unbroken male lineage or through a female ancestor only if her child was born after 1948, when Italian law allowed mothers to transmit citizenship if the father was unable to. This process typically takes 3 - 5 years

            In the case of a court application, an Italian attorney will represent you directly in court, meaning you won’t need to be personally involved in the legal proceedings.

            This route is typically faster than consular applications, with citizenship recognition often taking 1 to 3 years. It also eliminates the stress of dealing directly with bureaucratic hurdles, making the process much smoother for the applicant. We often say we deal with the headaches so you don’t have to.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What does 'Jure Sanguinis' mean in the context of Italian citizenship?</h3>
        <p>'Jure Sanguinis' is the Italian law that allows U.S. citizens and those born in the U.S. to claim Italian citizenship and an Italian passport through their Italian-born ancestors.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who is eligible for Italian citizenship by descent under the new 2025 rules?</h3>
        <p>Due to new generational limits introduced on March 28, 2025, you can now only obtain citizenship through an Italian-born grandparent or parent, or if your parent lived in Italy for at least two years prior to your birth.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the requirements to be eligible for Italian citizenship through descent?</h3>
        <p>Requirements include having an Italian parent or grandparent that was born in Italy and lived past March 17, 1861, having an Italian parent who lived in Italy for at least two years prior to your birth, and ensuring no one in the applicant's direct line renounced their Italian citizenship or became a citizen of another country before their child turned 21—or if it happened after 1992.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the methods to apply for Italian citizenship by descent?</h3>
        <p>There are three methods:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Consular Application:</strong> Suitable for straightforward cases where citizenship is passed down through an unbroken male lineage or through a female ancestor only if her child was born after 1948. This process typically takes 3–5 years.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Italian Municipality Application (Italian Relocation):</strong> By establishing residency in Italy, you can apply directly through the local municipality (comune). This process often enables individuals to obtain citizenship in under a year.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Italian Citizenship through a Court Case:</strong> Applicable if you're unable to secure a consulate appointment, your lineage includes an ancestor born to an Italian mother before 1948, or your case involves missing documents or special circumstances. An Italian attorney will represent you directly in court, and citizenship recognition often takes 1 to 3 years.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I determine if I qualify for Italian citizenship?</h3>
        <p>To determine your eligibility, gather key dates and details about your lineage, including birthdates for every direct ancestor tracing back to your last ancestor born in Italy, marriage dates for each direct descendant between you and your Italian-born ancestor, and naturalization history, including the date your Italian ancestor became a citizen of another country—or confirmation that they never naturalized.</p>
