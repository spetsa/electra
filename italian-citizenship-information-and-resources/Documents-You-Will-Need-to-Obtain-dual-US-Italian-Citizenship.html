            <p>Due to new generational limits introduced on March, 28th 2025, you can now only obtain citizenship through an Italian-born grandparent or parent, or if your parent lived in Italy for at least two years prior to your birth.</p>

    <div class="faq-container">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What documents are required to apply for Italian citizenship by descent?</h3>
        <p>Regardless of where you are applying, the following documents are essential for any Jure Sanguinis case:</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Birth, marriage, and death certificates of your Italian ancestor.</p>
        <p>• Birth, marriage, and death certificates of any direct ancestors in the Italian lineage (your parent, grandparent, etc. who are a direct descendant of the Italian ancestor you are applying through).</p>
        <p>• Your own birth and marriage certificates.</p>
        <p>• Naturalization or non-naturalization document(s) that prove that your Italian ancestor did not renounce citizenship before the birth of the next descendant or they naturalized after the next descendant was 21 years or older.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What extra documents might I need for my Italian citizenship application?</h3>
        <p>The following documents are typically required only if they pertain to someone in your direct lineage and impact your case — for example, to explain discrepancies in names or surnames on key documents or if you are unable to produce a specific key document.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whether these documents must be included will ultimately be at the discretion of your lawyer, commune, or consulate based on the specific requirements of your case.</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Adoption records if anyone in your lineage is adopted</p>
        <p>• Divorce records if anyone is divorced</p>
        <p>• Military records</p>
        <p>• A Document of Non-Existence is an official statement from the government entity responsible for issuing a specific document, confirming that the document does not exist, has been lost, or has been destroyed.</p>
        <p>• In a 1948 case you will need naturalization documents to prove that the female ancestor through whom citizenship is being claimed was eligible to pass citizenship down. Additionally, you will need naturalization records for her partner to verify that he was naturalized.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are document requirements different depending on the Italian consulate?</h3>
        <p>If you are applying through a consulate, you may be required to provide additional records for individuals outside your direct lineage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This often means submitting birth, marriage, and death certificates not only for your direct Italian ancestors but also for their spouse or partner (e.g., your mother/father, grandparent etc.).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Requirements vary by consulate, so it’s important to verify what specific documents are needed for your case.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I prepare foreign documents for an Italian citizenship application?</h3>
        <p>While official Italian documents do not require additional processing, all foreign documents must be properly processed according to the specific requirements of your consulate or court case.</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Apostille Authentication: Documents like birth, marriage, and naturalization certificates must be apostilled, confirming their validity for international use.</p>
        <p>• Translation into Italian: Documents must be translated into Italian by a certified translator. For court submissions, translations must be sworn-in, in Italian court and certified.</p>
        <p>• Certification of Translations: Translations may need certification by a public notary or consulate, depending on the location of the application.</p>
        <p>• Legalization (if needed): If the country is not part of the Hague Convention, documents will require legalization by the foreign ministry and the Italian consulate.</p>
        <p>• Consulate-Specific Requirements: The requirements may vary by consulate.
