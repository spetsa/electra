      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Am I eligible for Italian citizenship through my parents or grandparents?</h3>
        <p>You may qualify for Italian citizenship by descent if your parent or grandparent was born in Italy and was still an Italian citizen at the time of their child's birth. However, due to new laws passed in 2025, eligibility is now mostly limited to individuals with an Italian-born parent or grandparent—unless your parent lived in Italy for at least two years before you were born.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What documents do I need to apply for Italian citizenship through my grandparents?</h3>
        <p>If you're applying through a grandparent, you'll need their Italian birth certificate, marriage record, your parent’s birth and marriage records, your own birth certificate, and proof of your ancestor’s naturalization status. Apostilles and certified translations are required for all non-Italian documents.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does it take to collect documents for Italian dual citizenship?</h3>
        <p>It can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. U.S. records are usually obtained quickly (with exepctions for places like New York City), but Italian records typically take can take 1 – 4 months or more. If name or birth date discrepancies require corrections or amendments it can take additional mnths or even a year.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where can I find my ancestor’s naturalization or immigration records for an Italian citizenship application?</h3>
        <p>You can search for U.S. naturalization and immigration records through the National Archives (NARA), the USCIS Genealogy Program, or state and local archives. Census data, passenger lists, and court indexes can also help determine whether your ancestor became a citizen — and when.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
    
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I check if I qualify for Italian citizenship by descent?</h3>
        <p>The fastest way is to find out if your last Italian-born ancestor was still a citizen when their child was born. You’ll need to gather birth and naturalization records to verify this.
